[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/GodotOperations.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GodotOperations/)

Operations provides a quick and efficient way to programmatically create animations and complex behavior trees in the Godot game engine. A large collection of built-in operations are provided, with custom operations being very easy to make. It is available it both C# and GDSCript. For API usage and examples, see either the [GDScript README](https://github.com/chrisizeful/Operations/tree/main/addons/OperationsScript) or the [C# README](https://github.com/chrisizeful/Operations/tree/main/addons/OperationsSharp).
